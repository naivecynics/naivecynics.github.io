I come from **Foshan**, Guangdong Province, a city rich in culinary delights and cultural heritage. I am currently studying Computer Science at the Southern University of Science and Technology, and I am deeply passionate about this discipline, especially the emerging field of deep learning. I enjoy the process of transforming abstract thoughts into rigorous and elegant paradigms, and programming has become my tool and medium for exploring the unknown world.
