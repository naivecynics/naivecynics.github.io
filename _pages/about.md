I come from Foshan, Guangdong Province, a city rich in culinary delights and cultural heritage.

I am currently studying Computer Science at the College of Engineering, SUSTech.

I am deeply passionate about this discipline, especially the emerging field of deep learning. I enjoy the process of transforming abstract ideas into rigorous and elegant paradigms—programming has become my medium for exploring the unknown.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **signal processing**, **language models**, and **music information retrieval**. I’m particularly fascinated by how machines can understand structured and unstructured human signals—be it speech, music, or text—and how we can model these forms of expression computationally.
